Section: Usando la clase Patroller

Para crear un personaje movil se le define de clase Patroller.

	The perro is a Patroller in the Dog Kennel.

Section: Iniciando y deteniendo un personaje m√≥vil

Un personaje m√≥vil empieza el juego siendo un personaje inactivo. As√≠ que debe ser indicado expl√≠citamente cuando inician su ruta. Para lograr esto usamos la frase 'Activate <personaje>'. Se pude hacer esto por el ejemplo en las reglas de inicio de juego o cualqier otra regla:

	When play begins:
		activate the Dog.

	After opening the gate:
		activate the Dog.

Podemos de forma similar detener el personaje m√≥vil:

	After giving the bone to the dog:
		deactivate the dog.

Section: Especificando la posibilidad de que un personaje m√≥vil se mueva

Podemos especificar c√≥mo de probable es que un personaje m√≥vil se mueva en cada turno seleccionando un valor para el atributo 'Drive' entre 0 y 100. Un valor de 100 implica que el personaje se mueve siempre. Un ejemplo con un 40% ser√≠a:

	The Drunken Lord is a Patroller in the Bar.  The Drunken Lord is Aimless.
	The Drive of the Drunken Lord is 40.

Section: Indicando la frecuencia con el que los personajes se mueven

Se puede fijar si el personaje m√≥vil se mueve cada turno, cada dos turnos, etc... dando un valor al atributo Frequency. Un valor de 1 indica cada turno, 2 cada dos turnos, etc... Por defecto los personajes m√≥viles se mueven cada turno.

	The Sightseer is a Patroller in the Quadrangle.  The Turn Frequency of the Sightseer is 4.

Los personajes se mueven siempre el primer turno cuando son activados (On Patrol).

Si el valor de Turn Frequency es inferior a 1, se indicar√° el error.
